NOTE: If you are working by yourself (no teammates), then ignore this file
(self_reflection_2.txt) and use file   self_reflection_1.txt   instead.
If you are working with teammates, then the order
of the names in your team repository determines who uses which of the three
self_reflection_X.txt files, as per this example:
   For team     csse120-202110-andersm3-morrisnc-sheerimm
     -- anderssm3 must use   self_reflection_1.txt
     -- morrisnc  must use   self_reflection_2.txt
     -- sheerimm  must use   self_reflection_3.txt
Another example:
   For team     csse120-202101-kintnecm-rams-harristj
     -- kintnecm  must use   self_reflection_1.txt
     -- rams      must use   self_reflection_2.txt
     -- harristj  must use   self_reflection_3.txt
