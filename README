1. Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.
Shopping Simulator. Well the initial goal of this game is to go around a store and find certain items on your checklist.
However, the game in its current situation lets you free roam around a 1980s era department store (presumably Sears).
It also tells your current location in the store.

2. List the names of the classes in your project.
Store Floor, Departments, Protagonist, Checklist, Locator, Radio

3. If working with partner(s), indicate briefly how you divided up the work,
   that is, who did what?
I was the only one that worked on the project.

4. List the modules (libraries) that you used (the things in IMPORT statements).
    Random, Pygame, sys, Math

5. Briefly list what things in the project are beyond what you learned
   from the regular classwork in CSSE 120.  Include the major PyGame features
   that you used in this list.
   One this that I learned that was beyond the regular classwork was making the background move.
   This made it feel as if the protagonist was moving.
   Another thing was creating a locator. What made this so difficult was doing the math of where the
   hitbox was of the department. It could tell if the protagonists coordinates were in the box or not.
